            <span>I am a passionate Frontend Developer from near Rosenheim, and I love creating innovative and creative
                solutions. Ever since I discovered coding, every project has been a new adventure that challenges and
                inspires me.<br>
                My focus is on designing modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing web applications. I enjoy working
                with the latest technologies and trends to create unique digital experiences. Clean code, performance,
                and a well-thought-out user experience are essential aspects of my work.<br>
                Whether it’s creative animations, interactive interfaces, or custom solutions – I am always excited
                about turning ideas into functional and aesthetic applications.</span>

                        scalable solutions that seamlessly integrate modern best practices while prioritizing
                        performance and maintainability. Every project I work on is designed with a mobile-first
                        approach, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices. I focus on implementing
                        essential features intuitively, balancing functionality with elegant simplicity.</span>
